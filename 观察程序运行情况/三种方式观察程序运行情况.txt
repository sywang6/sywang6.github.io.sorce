observability 3 ways  三种方式观察程序运行情况
logging,metrics and tracing
==========================================================

unifying theory  统一的理论
Every is based on events
logging- recording events 记录事件
metrics- data combined from  measuring events   从测量事件组合数据
tracing- recording events with causal ordering  按因果顺序记录事件

data combined from  measuring events put more specilically:metrics  "statistical统计 aggregates聚合 of properties of events 
聚合统计事件的属性,什么事件呢,周期产生的记录聚合体的瞬时值
which generate periodic events recording the instantaneous values of those aggregates"
==========================================================

often confused because they have thing in commom ,like a time line 经常使我们困惑,因为他们有相同点,比如说时间线
start with logging: crappy error happened  糟糕的错误发生了
tracing: impact of that error 错误的影响
metrics: how many errors of this type are happending in the system   某一类型的错误在系统里面发生了多少次

logs: discrete events:debug ,error,audit,request details 
crappy error happened

tracing can tell you the impact of that error for example did it cause a caller to fail or did it delay it?
tracing:request-scope causal info:latency,queries,IDs

metrics:guage counter histogram;success failure or customer
how many errors of this type are happending in this cluster?
not all metrics are meaningfully aggregatable,ex percentiles or averages 并不是所有的指标都是聚合

==========================================================


Let's use latency to compare a few tools
Log-envent(response time)
Metric-value(response time)
Trace-tree(response time)

event value and tree are outputs fo 输出 each corresponding 相应的 system

==========================================================
Logs show response time 

[20/Apr/2017:14:19:07] "GET /HTTP/1.1" 200 7918"""Mozilla/5.0(X11:U:Linuxi686;en-US;rv:1.8.1.11)
Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.11(Ubuntu-feisty)"**0/95491**

Look!this request took 95 milliseconds!

often a field or other to derive duration from logs
note there's complexity in this format,and often latency is timestamp math between events
